# Booyah.live Docs

Unofficial usermade documentation of the v3 API of the streaming platform called booyah

Since booyah does not provide documentation to its API, I writing this documentation to make the development of bots (or something else) easier for everyone.

I am not a booyah employee and I am not affiliated with them either. I am just a normal user

This work is in progress, I will update it when I have time available. The booyah api is too extensive to finish it in a few days.

Any useful contribution to the documentation is appreciated :)

>What does it mean when an entry says Private and Public in the docs?

Means whether an API is accessible to everyone (Public) or only to your own user (Private).
